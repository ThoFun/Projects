## Description
NeedAHand is an application that allows the customer to repair a damage that occurred at home.

The customer can create an advertisement and the application will give him a selection of craftsmen who can fix the problem.
<br><br>
For this purpose, an algorithm is used that takes into account the necessary experience, reputation, availability and budget, the distance between customer and craftsmen.

Moreover, the customer can accept the offer and the application will show the selected craftsmen the contact details of the customer.
After the job is done, the customer and the craftsmen can rate each other.
